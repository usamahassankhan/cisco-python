    "## Q1) Define object oriented programming language?\n",
    "Object oriented programming language is an approach or practice, it is based on classes.Object-oriented programming (OOP) refers to a type of computer programming (software design) in which programmers define not only the data type of a data structure, but also the types of operations (functions) that can be applied to the data structure."

    "Following are the benefits of OOP:\n",
    "\n",
    "1- The code can be written once and can be used again and again.\n",
    "2- Wrapping of data and function into same entity so that it can be written once and can be used again anywhere in the whole program.\n",
    "3- Object Oriented Programs force designers to go through an extensive planning phase, which makes for better designs with less flaws.\n",
    "4- OOP provides a clear modular structure for programs.\n",
    "5- It is good for defining abstract data types.\n",
    "6- Implementation details are hidden from other modules.\n",
    "7- It is easy to maintain and modify existing code.\n",
    "8- It implements real life scenario."
